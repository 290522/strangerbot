A police report for harassment/defamation will be filed if you pass off another user's contact as if it is yours.** To report a user, enter **/report (followed by a reason; don't leave blank)** into the chat. If chat with a user you want to report has already ended, then **do not** start a new chat—immediately contact the admin @aaldentnay . **Also, a note to some guys here—pls stop being thirsty on here because that scares new users away; I'm taking a huge leapt of faith when I set up a platform like this. Those reported will be PERMANENTLY banned.** Misuse of /report , if not accidental, can also result in ban.`

Use /start to start looking for a conversational partner, once you're matched you can use /end to end the conversation.

Use /report to report a user, use it as follows:
/report <reason>

Use /nopics to disable receiving photos, and /nopics if you want to enable it again.
